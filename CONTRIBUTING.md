This project follows the [Contributor
Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct.

Here is what you should do in order to contribute:

1. Create a Github account if you don't already have one.
2. Create a Fork of this repository -- This will make a clone of the
   repository in your account.  **DO NOT** directly clone this one.  Once
   you've made the fork you will clone the forked version to
   your local machine for development.
3. Check the Trello list for something to do.
4. Follow the instructions above to get the dev environment ready.
5. Fix or add your own features.  Commit and push to your forked version of the
   repository.  When everything is tested and ready to be incorporated into the
   master version make a pull request via GitHub.   
6. Run tests and use the linter!
7. Make a Pull Request to get your feature(s) added to the main repository.

Usual git workflow:
1. ` git clone <your_forked_repo>`
   If the repo is already forked please remember to sync it with the upstream
   repo. Check [this](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) to know
   how to do it.
2. Resolve the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Build the `bundle.js` with `npm run build`
4. Make your mods
5. Test it with `npm run test`
6. Check the linting `npm run lint`
7. Be sure to rebuild with `npm run build` to see the fresh changes.
8. ` git add <modified_file_name>`
9. ` git commit -m "Commit message"`
10. ` git push -u origin master`

This will make your mods available in your newly forked repo.
Once everything is ready, create pull request upstream (against this original
repo).
